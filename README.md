## Introduction

House Price Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the price of houses based on multiple features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc. This project aims to help potential buyers and real estate agents make informed decisions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple machine learning models for price prediction
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of data and results

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

2. Install the required packages. You can manually install the required packages. The common packages include `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib flask
    ```
    ```

## Usage

## Usage

1. Ensure that the dataset is in the `data` directory. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook bhp.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, evaluate the models, and make predictions.

4. The trained model is saved as `banglore_home_prices_model.pickle`. You can use this file to make predictions on new data.1. Ensure that the dataset is in the `data` directory. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

2. Start the Flask server:
    ```bash
    cd server
    python server.py
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in the `client` directory to access the web interface:
    ```bash
    open client/index.html  # or simply double-click on the file
    ```

4. Follow the instructions on the web interface to preprocess the data, train the models, evaluate the models, and make predictions.

5. The trained model is saved as `banglore_home_prices_model.pickle`. You can use this file to make predictions on new data.

## Data

The dataset used for this project includes various features such as:

- Location
- Size (square footage)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Year built
- ... and more.

Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and placed in the `data` directory.

## Models

This project implements and compares several machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost

## Results

The results of the models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The best-performing model is selected for making predictions.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.
